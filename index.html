                     This is my main and only electric guitar. I bought it second-hand in early 2023 after spending
                     more than three years searching for the best feeling and comfort while playing. And this was the
                     winner! The Tokay UES 78 is a semi-acoustic guitar crafted in Hamamatsu, Japan, renowned for its
                     exceptional suitability for jazz (but of course other genres). Its hollow body design enhances
                     resonance and warmth, producing a rich, full-bodied tone that I truly appreciate. The guitar
                     features a very comfortable neck and body (probably the main reasons I bought it). It doesn't
                     have anything exceptional aside from its excellent craftsmanship. It's evident that this specific
                     model is very similar—if not identical—to the Gibson 335 (but it's €2,400 cheaper!). I was
                     fortunate enough to do a blind comparison between this guitar and a true 335, and I couldn't
                     always tell which one was mine.">

                     The Altamira M01D is a gypsy guitar designed for traditional jazz and gypsy music styles. Its
                     'D' hole enhances its resonance and projection to the listener. Despite its large neck (48 mm),
                     the shape provides a very comfortable feel, making it easy to play. With its rich sound, this
                     guitar is a popular choice among both amateur musicians (like me) and professional musicians
                     seeking an authentic gypsy guitar experience. It comes with a set of 'Argentine' 0.11 strings,
                     the only set that can make you sound like Django. Since it is not commonly played by many
                     musicians, I couldn't find any used ones, so I decided to buy it from the only place in the
                     country that sells it: https://scavino.it/. The only downside of this guitar is that the player
                     may experience some fatigue when trying to listen to it while playing, as the D hole is quite
                     mono directional.">

                     appreciated for its sound quality and durability. I fetched this device from a seller for
                     just €10. Unfortunately, I had to send that to a repair shop since some gears were broken,
                     as well as its belt. I had it back for €45 but the shop (http://mittaselettronica.com/) did
                     a very great and valuable job.">

                     adjustable tracking force and anti-skate controls. This was gifted to me by a family friend. It
                     had been left in an attic among hash and dirt for probably more than thirty years. With a lot of
                     patience, and with the precious help of my father, we were able to restore it piece by piece.
                     Considering that the entire apparatus is 100% mechanical, it wasn't an easy job.">

                     The AIWA F350 tape reader, manufactured in the early 1990s, is a cassette player designed for
                     easy playback of audio cassettes. It features an interface with controls for play, rewind, fast
                     forward, a headphone jack, automatic repeat, and Dolby B-C. The device was designed to minimize
                     background noise and provide very high audio quality. It is capable of recording as well. The
                     tape reader still belongs to my father, who gently conceded it on to me. The fidelity of the
                     recordings is quite astonishing for such a device. At the time of writing, I've done myself more than 20
                     recordings with this device from various sources including vinyl, CDs, digital tracks, audio streaming and the
                     only noticeable degradation (at least to my ear) occurred when I play back recordings from .wav files.
                     Nevertheless, after being stored in a cellar for five years, it was not without malfunctions.
                     Sending it to a repair shop was the best idea and the repair did really great! Worth to check it

                     Unfortunately, the labels were too scratched to allow me to find out the specific model. Overall,
                     it seems to be a well-made Class C amplifier compatible with Dolby 5.1. Every device I use to play
                     music is connected to it, and I can easily switch between inputs using the buttons on the front or
                     via a remote control. I bought it for €80.">

                     This is my audio cassettes collection. Yes, I'm one of those collectors of records on tape! At the time of
                     writing, the number has reached 124 units. A good portion of them were recorded by my father from
                     vinyl records that he acquired in the late '80s, others have been recently created by me, and the
                     remaining 'colored' you might notice in the picture were found by me while scouting vintage markets
                     or during my travels abroad in Europe and North America. Some of my favorite records in this
                     collection are The Weather Report, Emerson Lake & Palmer, America, Asia, The Alan Parsons Project,
                     Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Liquid Tension Experiment, George Benson, Glenn Miller, Grant Green,
                     Pat Metheny and Miles Davis. Most of the recorded cassettes are branded TDK, a few Maxell and they
                     range from 60 up to 100 minutes. The current average age of all is about 40 years old and
                     the oldest belongs to 'America' released in 1971, the newest belongs to 'Sheer Mag - Playing
                     Favourites' released on March 1, 2024. This collection will surely increase in the future.">

                     1024x768 pixels. The laptop is equipped with processors from the Celeron family and has 256MB
                     of RAM (which is actually upgradeable to a maximum of 2GB). Its storage capacity is 42GB. This
                     specific laptop still runs on Windows XP, which was the prevalent operating system at the time.
                     It includes a variety of ports, including 2 USB 1.0 ports, an Ethernet port (RJ-45), a modem port
                     (RJ-11), VGA, a headphone jack, a microphone input, and a floppy disk drive. This particular model
                     comes with an S-Video out port for connecting to TVs or external displays, a PCMCIA slot for
                     adding expansion cards (such as network cards or additional ports), and, of course, a power
                     connector for the power adapter. Overall, I think the Compaq Presario 2100 was a very good
                     budget-friendly option for users performing everyday computing tasks during the early 2000s.
                     This one comes from a friend who bought it in 2003, used it until 2014, and since then
                     kept in a display case until 2024 when she decided to gift it to me. Despite its battery is
                     totally gone it still work like the first day of its life, however, (fortunately) this is not my
                     main computer.">

                     The Zenit XP12 is a 35mm single-lens reflex (SLR) camera that was manufactured in the Soviet Union,
                      specifically by the Krasnogorsk Mechanical Plant, starting in the early 1980s. It is known for
                      its robust build and mechanical reliability, making it a popular choice among amateur photographers
                      (also mostly for its very cheap price). The camera is often paired with the Helios 44M-4 lens,
                      which is a 58mm f/2 lens renowned for its unique bokeh and sharpness. The Helios 44M-4 features a
                      classic design with a 6-element, 4-group  optical construction and a 49mm filter thread.
                      It is particularly noted for its ability to produce a swirly bokeh effect, making it a favorite
                      for portrait and artistic photography. The lens is also compatible with various camera mounts,
                      allowing for versatility in use with different camera bodies. This model belonged to my grandfather,
                      and until the early 2000s, it was its main camera.">

        <div class="lower-title">BEING AN IMPARTIAL</div>
        <div class="pb-3 mb-4 border-bottom"></div>
        <div class="lower-description">
            Being an Impartial is way of being that can appear strange or incomprehensible to several people.
            <br><br>
            Nevertheless, an Impartial is a strong believer in rational analysis of situations. Many people confuse it
            in lack of convictions or disinterest in taking a stance. On the contrary, an impartial follows
            clear and defined principles, striving to apply them in a balanced way, without definitive and clear
            alignments in most situations.
            <br><br>
            Usually the goal of many impartials is to promote dialogue, mutual understanding, and peaceful conflict
            resolution. This approach does not stem from indecision or weakness, but from the conviction that it is
            the best way to face life's situations.
            <br><br>
            However, this attitude many times is misunderstood by giving the impression of detachment or apathy. In
            reality, there is strong effort to maintain calm and analyze situations from multiple perspectives before
            acting or taking any position. It is believed that the truth rarely lies on just one side and that the best
            solutions emerge from confrontation and the ability on listening to others.
            <br><br>
            Impartials have many pros:
            <br><br>
            <b>Fairness</b>: Impartial individuals treat everyone equally, ensuring that decisions are made based on
            merit
            rather than personal biases or relationships.
            <br><br>
            <b>Objectivity</b>: They are sincere and able to assess situations and information without being influenced
            by emotions or preconceived notions, leading to more rational and sound conclusions.
            <br><br>
            <b>Conflict resolution</b>: Impartiality fosters trust and respect, doing their best to mediate conflicts
            and find common ground among differing parties or opinions.
            <br><br>
            <b>Encouragement of open dialogue</b>: Their neutrality can create an environment where diverse
            perspectives can be shared and discussed openly, promoting collaboration, understanding and peace.
            <br><br>
            <b>Better on decision-making</b>: Impartiality allows for a comprehensive evaluation of as many as possible
            of all relevant factors, leading to more balanced decisions.
            <br><br>
            <b>Promotion of equality</b>: An impartial approach helps to dismantle systemic biases and promotes
            equality, contributing to a fair society.
            <br><br>
            <b>Friendliness</b>: Most individuals are genuinely nice and friendly to everyone. It is very unlikely that
            they will ever start an argument or a fight.
            <br><br>
            <b>Helpful</b>: Offering help in difficult situations may be essential for most of them. Their genuine
            approach to problem-solving creates a strong bond with people in need. This is usually how they show their
            empathy.
            <br><br>
            I wish people can truly understand this way of being, which is not indifference, but a sincere desire to
            create harmony and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
