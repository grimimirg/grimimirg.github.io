        data-description="This is my main and only electric guitar. I bought it second-hand in early 2023 after spending
                     more than three years searching for the best feeling and comfort while playing. And this was the
                     winner! The Tokay UES 78 is a semi-acoustic guitar crafted in Hamamatsu, Japan, renowned for its
                     exceptional suitability for jazz (but of course other genres). Its hollow body design enhances
                     resonance and warmth, producing a rich, full-bodied tone that I truly appreciate. The guitar
                     features a very comfortable neck and body (probably the main reasons I bought it). It doesn't
                     have anything exceptional aside from its excellent craftsmanship. It's evident that this specific
                     model is very similar—if not identical—to the Gibson 335 (but it's €2,400 cheaper!). I was
                     fortunate enough to do a blind comparison between this guitar and a true 335, and I couldn't
                     always tell which one was mine.">

        data-description="The Altamira M01D is a gypsy guitar designed for traditional jazz and gypsy music styles. Its
                     'D' hole enhances its resonance and projection to the listener. Despite its large neck (48 mm),
                     the shape provides a very comfortable feel, making it easy to play. With its rich sound, this
                     guitar is a popular choice among both amateur musicians (like me) and professional musicians
                     seeking an authentic gypsy guitar experience. It comes with a set of 'Argentine' 0.11 strings,
                     the only set that can make you sound like Django. Since it is not commonly played by many
                     musicians, I couldn't find any used ones, so I decided to buy it from the only place in the
                     country that sells it: https://scavino.it/. The only downside of this guitar is that the player
                     may experience some fatigue when trying to listen to it while playing, as the D hole is quite
                     mono directional.">

                     forward, a headphone jack, automatic repeat, and Dolby B-C. The device was designed to minimize
                     background noise and provide very high audio quality. It is capable of recording as well. The
                     tape reader still belongs to my father, who gently conceded it on to me. The fidelity of the
                     recordings is quite astonishing for such a device. At the time of writing, I've done myself more than 20
                     recordings with this device from various sources including vinyl, CDs, digital tracks, audio streaming and the
                     only noticeable degradation (at least to my ear) occurred when I play back recordings from .wav files.
                     Nevertheless, after being stored in a cellar for five years, it was not without malfunctions.

                     remaining 'colored' you might notice in the picture were found by me while scouting vintage markets
                     or during my travels abroad in Europe and North America. Some of my favorite records in this
                     collection are The Weather Report, Emerson Lake & Palmer, America, Asia, The Alan Parsons Project,
                     Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Liquid Tension Experiment, George Benson, Glenn Miller, Grant Green,
                     Pat Metheny and Miles Davis. Most of the recorded cassettes are branded TDK, a few Maxell and they
                     range from 60 up to 100 minutes. The current average age of all is about 40 years old and
                     the oldest belongs to 'America' released in 1971, the newest belongs to 'Sheer Mag - Playing
                     Favourites' released on March 1, 2024. This collection will surely increase in the future.">

        data-description="The COMPAQ Presario 2100 series is a line of laptops introduced in 2003, designed for general use,
                     targeting home and small business users. It features a 15-inch display with a resolution of
                     1024x768 pixels. The laptop is equipped with processors from the Celeron family and has 256MB
                     of RAM (which is actually upgradeable to a maximum of 2GB). Its storage capacity is 42GB. This
                     specific laptop still runs on Windows XP, which was the prevalent operating system at the time.
                     It includes a variety of ports, including 2 USB 1.0 ports, an Ethernet port (RJ-45), a modem port
                     (RJ-11), VGA, a headphone jack, a microphone input, and a floppy disk drive. This particular model
                     comes with an S-Video out port for connecting to TVs or external displays, a PCMCIA slot for
                     adding expansion cards (such as network cards or additional ports), and, of course, a power
                     connector for the power adapter. Overall, I think the Compaq Presario 2100 was a very good
                     budget-friendly option for users performing everyday computing tasks during the early 2000s.
                     This one comes from a friend who bought it in 2003, used it until 2014, and since then
                     kept in a display case until 2024 when she decided to gift it to me. Despite its battery is
                     totally gone it still work like the first day of its life, however, (fortunately) this is not my
                     main computer.">

                      specifically by the Krasnogorsk Mechanical Plant, starting in the early 1980s. It is known for
                      its robust build and mechanical reliability, making it a popular choice among amateur photographers
                      (also mostly for its very cheap price). The camera is often paired with the Helios 44M-4 lens,
                      which is a 58mm f/2 lens renowned for its unique bokeh and sharpness. The Helios 44M-4 features a
                      classic design with a 6-element, 4-group  optical construction and a 49mm filter thread.
                      It is particularly noted for its ability to produce a swirly bokeh effect, making it a favorite
                      for portrait and artistic photography. The lens is also compatible with various camera mounts,
                      allowing for versatility in use with different camera bodies. This model belonged to my grandfather,
                      and until the early 2000s, it was its main camera.">

    <div class="lower-description justified-text">
      Being an Impartial is way of being that can appear strange or incomprehensible to several people.
      <br><br>
      Nevertheless, an Impartial is a strong believer in rational analysis of situations. Many people confuse
      it
      in lack of convictions or disinterest in taking a stance. On the contrary, an impartial follows
      clear and defined principles, striving to apply them in a balanced way, without definitive and clear
      alignments in most situations.
      <br><br>
      Usually the goal of many impartials is to promote dialogue, mutual understanding, and peaceful conflict
      resolution. This approach does not stem from indecision or weakness, but from the conviction that it is
      the best way to face life's situations.
      <br><br>
      However, this attitude many times is misunderstood by giving the impression of detachment or apathy. In
      reality, there is strong effort to maintain calm and analyze situations from multiple perspectives
      before
      acting or taking any position. It is believed that the truth rarely lies on just one side and that the
      best
      solutions emerge from confrontation and the ability on listening to others.
      <br><br>
      <h4>Impartials have many pros:</h4>
      <br>
      <strong class="underline">Fairness</strong>: Impartial individuals treat everyone equally, ensuring that decisions
      are made based on
      merit
      rather than personal biases or relationships.
      <br><br>
      <strong class="underline">Objectivity</strong>: They are sincere and able to assess situations and information
      without being
      influenced
      by emotions or preconceived notions, leading to more rational and sound conclusions.
      <br><br>
      <strong class="underline">Conflict resolution</strong>: Impartiality fosters trust and respect, doing their best
      to mediate
      conflicts
      and find common ground among differing parties or opinions.
      <br><br>
      <strong class="underline">Encouragement of open dialogue</strong>: Their neutrality can create an environment
      where diverse
      perspectives can be shared and discussed openly, promoting collaboration, understanding and peace.
      <br><br>
      <strong class="underline">Better on decision-making</strong>: Impartiality allows for a comprehensive evaluation
      of as many as
      possible
      of all relevant factors, leading to more balanced decisions.
      <br><br>
      <strong class="underline">Promotion of equality</strong>: An impartial approach helps to dismantle systemic biases
      and promotes
      equality, contributing to a fair society.
      <br><br>
      <strong class="underline">Friendliness</strong>: Most individuals are genuinely nice and friendly to everyone. It
      is very unlikely
      that
      they will ever start an argument or a fight.
      <br><br>
      <strong class="underline">Helpful</strong>: Offering help in difficult situations may be essential for most of
      them. Their genuine
      approach to problem-solving creates a strong bond with people in need. This is usually how they show
      their
      empathy.
      <br><br>
      I wish people can truly understand this way of being, which is not indifference, but a sincere desire to
      create harmony and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
